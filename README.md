# Modular_DCGAN
Simple notebook containing a DCGAN that can be easily tweaked to learn to generate photos of anything.

All you need to use this is a bunch of photos of the thing or person you want to generate photos of. The photos do not have to be too uniform as I provided 3 prepping methods

**Open 'main_notebook.ipynb' for instructions. Google Colab recommended.**

This is a modified implementation of the keras DCGAN, it's simple, lightweight, and fun to play around with. It's also a nice starting point / template if someone wanted to increase the complexity.
